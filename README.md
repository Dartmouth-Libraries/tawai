Text Analysis in a World of AI

## 1. Set Up

To work with Python on your own computer, we recommend using **Visual Studio Code** with **virtual environments**. 

See our [**Programming with Python** guide](https://researchguides.dartmouth.edu/c.php?g=1313588&p=9658071) with detailed installation / set-up instructions.

## 2. Tutorials for working with texts in Python

### 2a. Introductory Materials in this repository

### 2b. Dartmouth Research Data Services Resources

Our other tutorials and coding notebooks for performing text analysis with Python are available in two places:
* in our **GitHub** repositories, see especially ?? and ??.
* on our **Jupyter Hub** server - where you can work with our notebooks interactively without needing to install Python or these notebooks on your own computer
    + to access these resources, follow [our instructions for using our JupyterHub platform](https://researchguides.dartmouth.edu/data_management/jupyter).
