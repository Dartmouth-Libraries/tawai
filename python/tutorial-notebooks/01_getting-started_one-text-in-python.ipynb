      "This Nation in the past two years has become an active partner in the\n",
      "world's greatest war against human slavery.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have joined with like-minded people in order to defend ourselves in a\n",
      "world that has been gravely threatened with gangster rule.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I do not think that any of us Americans can be content with mere\n",
      "survival. Sacrifices that we and our allies are making impose upon us all a\n",
      "sacred obligation to see to it that out of this war we and our children\n",
      "will gain something better than mere survival.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are united in determination that this war shall not be followed by\n",
      "another interim which leads to new disaster--that we shall not repeat the\n",
      "tragic errors of ostrich isolationism--that we shall not repeat the excesses\n",
      "of the wild twenties when this Nation went for a joy ride on a roller\n",
      "coaster which ended in a tragic crash.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Mr. Hull went to Moscow in October, and when I went to Cairo and\n",
      "Teheran in November, we knew that we were in agreement with our allies in\n",
      "our common determination to fight and win this war. But there were many\n",
      "vital questions concerning the future peace, and they were discussed in an\n",
      "atmosphere of complete candor and harmony.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the last war such discussions, such meetings, did not even begin until\n",
      "the shooting had stopped and the delegates began to assemble at the peace\n",
      "table. There had been no previous opportunities for man-to-man discussions\n",
      "which lead to meetings of minds. The result was a peace which was not a\n",
      "peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was a mistake which we are not repeating in this war.\n",
      "\n",
      "And right here I want to address a word or two to some suspicious souls who\n",
      "are fearful that Mr. Hull or I have made \"commitments\" for the future which\n",
      "might pledge this Nation to secret treaties, or to enacting the role of\n",
      "Santa Claus.\n",
      "\n",
      "To such suspicious souls--using a polite terminology--I wish to say that Mr.\n",
      "Churchill, and Marshal Stalin, and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek are all\n",
      "thoroughly conversant with the provisions of our Constitution. And so is\n",
      "Mr. Hull. And so am I.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course we made some commitments. We most certainly committed ourselves\n",
      "to very large and very specific military plans which require the use of all\n",
      "Allied forces to bring about the defeat of our enemies at the earliest\n",
      "possible time.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there were no secret treaties or political or financial commitments.\n",
      "\n",
      "The one supreme objective for the future, which we discussed for each\n",
      "Nation individually, and for all the United Nations, can be summed up in\n",
      "one word: Security.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that means not only physical security which provides safety from\n",
      "attacks by aggressors. It means also economic security, social security,\n",
      "moral security--in a family of Nations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the plain down-to-earth talks that I had with the Generalissimo and\n",
      "Marshal Stalin and Prime Minister Churchill, it was abundantly clear that\n",
      "they are all most deeply interested in the resumption of peaceful progress\n",
      "by their own peoples--progress toward a better life. All our allies want\n",
      "freedom to develop their lands and resources, to build up industry, to\n",
      "increase education and individual opportunity, and to raise standards of\n",
      "living.\n",
      "\n",
      "All our allies have learned by bitter experience that real development will\n",
      "not be possible if they are to be diverted from their purpose by repeated\n",
      "wars--or even threats of war.\n",
      "\n",
      "China and Russia are truly united with Britain and America in recognition\n",
      "of this essential fact:\n",
      "\n",
      "The best interests of each Nation, large and small, demand that all\n",
      "freedom-loving Nations shall join together in a just and durable system of\n",
      "peace. In the present world situation, evidenced by the actions of Germany,\n",
      "Italy, and Japan, unquestioned military control over disturbers of the\n",
      "peace is as necessary among Nations as it is among citizens in a community.\n",
      "And an equally basic essential to peace is a decent standard of living for\n",
      "all individual men and women and children in all Nations. Freedom from fear\n",
      "is eternally linked with freedom from want.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are people who burrow through our Nation like unseeing moles, and\n",
      "attempt to spread the suspicion that if other Nations are encouraged to\n",
      "raise their standards of living, our own American standard of living must\n",
      "of necessity be depressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact is the very contrary. It has been shown time and again that if the\n",
      "standard of living of any country goes up, so does its purchasing power--\n",
      "and that such a rise encourages a better standard of living in neighboring\n",
      "countries with whom it trades. That is just plain common sense--and it is\n",
      "the kind of plain common sense that provided the basis for our discussions\n",
      "at Moscow, Cairo, and Teheran.\n",
      "\n",
      "Returning from my journeyings, I must confess to a sense of \"let-down\" when\n",
      "I found many evidences of faulty perspective here in Washington. The faulty\n",
      "perspective consists in overemphasizing lesser problems and thereby\n",
      "underemphasizing the first and greatest problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overwhelming majority of our people have met the demands of this war\n",
      "with magnificent courage and understanding. They have accepted\n",
      "inconveniences; they have accepted hardships; they have accepted tragic\n",
      "sacrifices. And they are ready and eager to make whatever further\n",
      "contributions are needed to win the war as quickly as possible--if only\n",
      "they are given the chance to know what is required of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, while the majority goes on about its great work without complaint,\n",
      "a noisy minority maintains an uproar of demands for special favors for\n",
      "special groups. There are pests who swarm through the lobbies of the\n",
      "Congress and the cocktail bars of Washington, representing these special\n",
      "groups as opposed to the basic interests of the Nation as a whole. They\n",
      "have come to look upon the war primarily as a chance to make profits for\n",
      "themselves at the expense of their neighbors--profits in money or in terms\n",
      "of political or social preferment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such selfish agitation can be highly dangerous in wartime. It creates\n",
      "confusion. It damages morale. It hampers our national effort. It muddies\n",
      "the waters and therefore prolongs the war.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we analyze American history impartially, we cannot escape the fact that\n",
      "in our past we have not always forgotten individual and selfish and\n",
      "partisan interests in time of war--we have not always been united in purpose\n",
      "and direction. We cannot overlook the serious dissensions and the lack of\n",
      "unity in our war of the Revolution, in our War of 1812, or in our War\n",
      "Between the States, when the survival of the Union itself was at stake.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first World War we came closer to national unity than in any\n",
      "previous war. But that war lasted only a year and a half, and increasing\n",
      "signs of disunity began to appear during the final months of the conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this war, we have been compelled to learn how interdependent upon each\n",
      "other are all groups and sections of the population of America.\n",
      "\n",
      "Increased food costs, for example, will bring new demands for wage\n",
      "increases from all war workers, which will in turn raise all prices of all\n",
      "things including those things which the farmers themselves have to buy.\n",
      "Increased wages or prices will each in turn produce the same results. They\n",
      "all have a particularly disastrous result on all fixed income groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I hope you will remember that all of us in this Government represent\n",
      "the fixed income group just as much as we represent business owners,\n",
      "workers, and farmers. This group of fixed income people includes: teachers,\n",
      "clergy, policemen, firemen, widows and minors on fixed incomes, wives and\n",
      "dependents of our soldiers and sailors, and old-age pensioners. They and\n",
      "their families add up to one-quarter of our one hundred and thirty million\n",
      "people. They have few or no high pressure representatives at the Capitol.\n",
      "In a period of gross inflation they would be the worst sufferers.\n",
      "\n",
      "If ever there was a time to subordinate individual or group selfishness to\n",
      "the national good, that time is now. Disunity at home--bickerings,\n",
      "self-seeking partisanship, stoppages of work, inflation, business as usual,\n",
      "politics as usual, luxury as usual these are the influences which can\n",
      "undermine the morale of the brave men ready to die at the front for us\n",
      "here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those who are doing most of the complaining are not deliberately striving\n",
      "to sabotage the national war effort. They are laboring under the delusion\n",
      "that the time is past when we must make prodigious sacrifices--that the war\n",
      "is already won and we can begin to slacken off. But the dangerous folly of\n",
      "that point of view can be measured by the distance that separates our\n",
      "troops from their ultimate objectives in Berlin and Tokyo--and by the sum of\n",
      "all the perils that lie along the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overconfidence and complacency are among our deadliest enemies. Last\n",
      "spring--after notable victories at Stalingrad and in Tunisia and against the\n",
      "U-boats on the high seas--overconfidence became so pronounced that war\n",
      "production fell off. In two months, June and July, 1943, more than a\n",
      "thousand airplanes that could have been made and should have been made were\n",
      "not made. Those who failed to make them were not on strike. They were\n",
      "merely saying, \"The war's in the bag--so let's relax.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That attitude on the part of anyone--Government or management or labor--can\n",
      "lengthen this war. It can kill American boys.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us remember the lessons of 1918. In the summer of that year the tide\n",
      "turned in favor of the allies. But this Government did not relax. In fact,\n",
      "our national effort was stepped up. In August, 1918, the draft age limits\n",
      "were broadened from 21-31 to 18-45. The President called for \"force to the\n",
      "utmost,\" and his call was heeded. And in November, only three months later,\n",
      "Germany surrendered.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is the way to fight and win a war--all out--and not with half-an-eye on\n",
      "the battlefronts abroad and the other eye-and-a-half on personal, selfish,\n",
      "or political interests here at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, in order to concentrate all our energies and resources on\n",
      "winning the war, and to maintain a fair and stable economy at home, I\n",
      "recommend that the Congress adopt:\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) A realistic tax law--which will tax all unreasonable profits, both\n",
      "individual and corporate, and reduce the ultimate cost of the war to our\n",
      "sons and daughters. The tax bill now under consideration by the Congress\n",
      "does not begin to meet this test.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) A continuation of the law for the renegotiation of war contracts--which\n",
      "will prevent exorbitant profits and assure fair prices to the Government.\n",
      "For two long years I have pleaded with the Congress to take undue profits\n",
      "out of war.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) A cost of food law--which will enable the Government (a) to place a\n",
      "reasonable floor under the prices the farmer may expect for his production;\n",
      "and (b) to place a ceiling on the prices a consumer will have to pay for\n",
      "the food he buys. This should apply to necessities only; and will require\n",
      "public funds to carry out. It will cost in appropriations about one percent\n",
      "of the present annual cost of the war.\n",
      "\n",
      "(4) Early reenactment of the stabilization statute of October, 1942. This\n",
      "expires June 30, 1944, and if it is not extended well in advance, the\n",
      "country might just as well expect price chaos by summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "We cannot have stabilization by wishful thinking. We must take positive\n",
      "action to maintain the integrity of the American dollar.\n",
      "\n",
      "(5) A national service law--which, for the duration of the war, will\n",
      "prevent strikes, and, with certain appropriate exceptions, will make\n",
      "available for war production or for any other essential services every\n",
      "able-bodied adult in this Nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "These five measures together form a just and equitable whole. I would not\n",
      "recommend a national service law unless the other laws were passed to keep\n",
      "down the cost of living, to share equitably the burdens of taxation, to\n",
      "hold the stabilization line, and to prevent undue profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Federal Government already has the basic power to draft capital and\n",
      "property of all kinds for war purposes on a basis of just compensation.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you know, I have for three years hesitated to recommend a national\n",
      "service act. Today, however, I am convinced of its necessity. Although I\n",
      "believe that we and our allies can win the war without such a measure, I am\n",
      "certain that nothing less than total mobilization of all our resources of\n",
      "manpower and capital will guarantee an earlier victory, and reduce the toll\n",
      "of suffering and sorrow and blood.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have received a joint recommendation for this law from the heads of the\n",
      "War Department, the Navy Department, and the Maritime Commission. These are\n",
      "the men who bear responsibility for the procurement of the necessary arms\n",
      "and equipment, and for the successful prosecution of the war in the field.\n",
      "They say:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When the very life of the Nation is in peril the responsibility for\n",
      "service is common to all men and women. In such a time there can be no\n",
      "discrimination between the men and women who are assigned by the Government\n",
      "to its defense at the battlefront and the men and women assigned to\n",
      "producing the vital materials essential to successful military operations.\n",
      "A prompt enactment of a National Service Law would be merely an expression\n",
      "of the universality of this responsibility.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe the country will agree that those statements are the solemn\n",
      "truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "National service is the most democratic way to wage a war. Like selective\n",
      "service for the armed forces, it rests on the obligation of each citizen to\n",
      "serve his Nation to his utmost where he is best qualified.\n",
      "\n",
      "It does not mean reduction in wages. It does not mean loss of retirement\n",
      "and seniority rights and benefits. It does not mean that any substantial\n",
      "numbers of war workers will be disturbed in their present jobs. Let these\n",
      "facts be wholly clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Experience in other democratic Nations at war--Britain, Canada, Australia,\n",
      "and New Zealand--has shown that the very existence of national service\n",
      "makes unnecessary the widespread use of compulsory power. National service\n",
      "has proven to be a unifying moral force based on an equal and comprehensive\n",
      "legal obligation of all people in a Nation at war.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are millions of American men and women who are not in this war at\n",
      "all. It is not because they do not want to be in it. But they want to know\n",
      "where they can best do their share. National service provides that\n",
      "direction. It will be a means by which every man and woman can find that\n",
      "inner satisfaction which comes from making the fullest possible\n",
      "contribution to victory.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know that all civilian war workers will be glad to be able to say many\n",
      "years hence to their grandchildren: \"Yes, I, too, was in service in the\n",
      "great war. I was on duty in an airplane factory, and I helped make hundreds\n",
      "of fighting planes. The Government told me that in doing that I was\n",
      "performing my most useful work in the service of my country.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It is argued that we have passed the stage in the war where national\n",
      "service is necessary. But our soldiers and sailors know that this is not\n",
      "true. We are going forward on a long, rough road--and, in all journeys, the\n",
      "last miles are the hardest. And it is for that final effort--for the total\n",
      "defeat of our enemies--that we must mobilize our total resources. The\n",
      "national war program calls for the employment of more people in 1944 than\n",
      "in 1943.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is my conviction that the American people will welcome this win-the-war\n",
      "measure which is based on the eternally just principle of \"fair for one,\n",
      "fair for all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It will give our people at home the assurance that they are standing\n",
      "four-square behind our soldiers and sailors. And it will give our enemies\n",
      "demoralizing assurance that we mean business--that we, 130,000,000\n",
      "Americans, are on the march to Rome, Berlin, and Tokyo.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope that the Congress will recognize that, although this is a political\n",
      "year, national service is an issue which transcends politics. Great power\n",
      "must be used for great purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to the machinery for this measure, the Congress itself should determine\n",
      "its nature--but it should be wholly nonpartisan in its make-up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our armed forces are valiantly fulfilling their responsibilities to our\n",

      "taking those measures which are essential to national security in this the\n",
      "most decisive phase of the Nation's greatest war.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several alleged reasons have prevented the enactment of legislation which\n",
      "would preserve for our soldiers and sailors and marines the fundamental\n",
      "prerogative of citizenship--the right to vote. No amount of legalistic\n",
      "argument can becloud this issue in the eyes of these ten million American\n",
      "citizens. Surely the signers of the Constitution did not intend a document\n",
      "which, even in wartime, would be construed to take away the franchise of\n",
      "any of those who are fighting to preserve the Constitution itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our soldiers and sailors and marines know that the overwhelming majority of\n",
      "them will be deprived of the opportunity to vote, if the voting machinery\n",
      "is left exclusively to the States under existing State laws--and that there\n",
      "is no likelihood of these laws being changed in time to enable them to vote\n",
      "at the next election. The Army and Navy have reported that it will be\n",
      "impossible effectively to administer forty-eight different soldier voting\n",
      "laws. It is the duty of the Congress to remove this unjustifiable\n",
      "discrimination against the men and women in our armed forces--and to do it\n",
      "as quickly as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is our duty now to begin to lay the plans and determine the strategy for\n",
      "the winning of a lasting peace and the establishment of an American\n",
