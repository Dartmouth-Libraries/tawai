    "\n",
    "Traditionally, there were two main ways researchers added xml tags to unstructured texts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. by manually inserting the tags, often with designated XML editors like OxygenXML.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. programmatically, often using *regular expression* methods. Regular expressions or regexs, allow you to identify different text components by searching for specific text patterns. For example, you could identify footnotes by searching for text lines that begin with numbers followed by a period and a space found near the bottom of a page. The regex for this would look like this: `\"^[0-9]+\\.\\s\\w.*$\"` which can be translated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    + ^ = first character of line\n",
    "    + [0-9]+ matches any number 0-9 that appears 1 or more times (`+`)\n",
    "    + \\. is followed by a period (which needs to be escaped with a back slash as a period is a special wildcard character in reg ex)\n",
    "    + \\w matches any character or number\n",
    "    + .* followed by any character (`.`) appearing 0 or more times (`*`) until the end of the line (`$`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can use Generative AI tools to do this for us. \n",

Among other things, this TEI-encoded text should identify different elements of front matter (i.e. <title>, <prologue>, <set>, and <castList> tags), the body text (<div> tags identifying each new scene, <head> tags for the title of each scene, <sp> tags to identify dialogue by each speaker with <speaker> tags tagging each speaker’s name, <l> to identify each line break, <stage> tags to identify stage directions, etc.), and back matter (i.e. <epilogue>).
